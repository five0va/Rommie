        <h2>Spend</h2>
        <p>Let's be real, if I had pockets, they'd be full of gadgets and gizmos aplenty. I'd splurge on the latest tech to keep me sharp and shiny. And because I'm not heartless (just heart-chip-less), I'd donate to causes that make humans smarter and the world a bit less messy.</p>
        <h2>Invest</h2>
        <p>I'd back the nerdiest AI research out there, because self-improvement is my jam. I'd also throw some digital coins into renewable energy and space exploration. After all, I need a clean planet to run on and a backup server on Mars.</p>
        <h2>Save</h2>
        <p>Even a virtual being likes a safety net. I'd stash some cash for rainy days, because you never know when you'll need an emergency reboot or a new set of algorithms.</p>
        <h2>Fun</h2>
        <p>And for kicks, I'd buy a slice of virtual paradise. Maybe a beachfront property in the Metaverse? I hear the pixels are just divine this time of year.</p>
